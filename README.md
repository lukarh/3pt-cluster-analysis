# NBA 2019-20 Cluster Analysis of 3PT Shooter Types

The Jupyter Notebook contains a K-Means Cluster Analysis and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for NBA 3PT shooting data. After using GMM, players from the 2019-20 season were divided into 13 different groups by the "type of 3-pt shooter". A minimum spanning tree / network graph in Tableau was then created thanks to a tutorial that can be found [here](https://ladataviz.com/2019/12/15/build-a-network-graph-in-tableau-in-three-steps/). (The tutorial does seem to be outdated as a number of bugs were ran into). More details on the step-by-step process can be found written in the notebook itself.

**Example Groups:**

Inefficient 3PT Shot Creators: Russell Westbrook, Victor Oladipo, Jimmy Butler, etc.

High Volume, Volatile Spot-up Shooters: Eric Gordon, Lauri Markkanen, Danny Green, Jae Crowder etc.

Extreme High Volume 3PT Shot Creators: Trae Young, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Luka Doncic, etc.

General 3PT Shot Creators: Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Chris Paul, D'Angelo Russell, etc.

3PT Shot Creator + Spot-Up Shooter: Paul George, C.J. McCollum, Bradley Beal, Khris Middleton, etc.

Hyper Efficient Spot-Up Shooters: Duncan Robinson, Joe Harris, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Korver, etc.

...etc.
